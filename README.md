# Your Personal Nagger

This web app allows the user to log data for self evaluation, it's like someone nagging you all the time asking you: are you doing this? Are you doing that?

### Use
Clone the repo locally and launch the node server locally:

```
node app.js
```

Alternatively you can double click on the .bat file.

### Future Development
At the moment it does not allow to customize the criteria, and areas of life are used as placeholder. The plan is to make them customizable by changing the questions.csv file in the /public/templates folder.

Also answers are saved in JSON format in the /public/data folder. In the future I hope to make them downloadable into csv format as well.
